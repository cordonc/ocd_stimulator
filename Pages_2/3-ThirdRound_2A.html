       <p class="thoughts-1">You pick one of them; it doesn’t feel quite right. Maybe another one – have to try them all. </p>

       <p class="thoughts-2">This initial favorite pen will do just fine– but I kind of feel guilty now. Why does it feel like I’ve abandoned the other pen? Why am I personifying this pen as if it has feelings? Maybe I should switch to the other one. 
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-3">The other one is working pretty well– while you’re writing your intrusive thoughts, you begin to wonder how your thoughts should be color-coded. That way when you’ll look back on your notes, you can self-reflect on your feelings and learn from them from a different perspecctive.I mean you don’t want to look like some crazy psycho that goes on rambling, unintelligible chicken-scratch if someone ver does pick up this journal. <br> <br> What if I die an untimely death and they have my memory of this awful, unorganized chicken scratch? After all, you really have to consider how you’ll be perceived in the after life. Other peoples perception of you will live on through other peoples opinions about you– there’s no way to defend yourself when you’re dead. Gotta make sure you’ve made the most out of your life when you’re still alive. Cause, like, who knows when I’ll die? Accidents happen all the time. <br><br> Nothing is certain. <br><br> Time is precious and I have to make the most of it. <br><br> Don’t take this moment for granted.
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-4">Ugly pen is painful to use, but it will do. After all, healing comes from pain, and pain is what I need. 
        This is surely the best decision.
       </p>
