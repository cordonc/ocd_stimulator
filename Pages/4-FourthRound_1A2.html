                <p class="H2">You decide against showering, You already gave into your first compulsion for cleaning. 
                    It’s time to start that project proposal. 
                    You need to write out a general outline for your paper. You have several options. 
                    There’s many different colored pens to choose from.</p>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">1. The navy-blue pen size .5</a>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">2. The navy-blue pen size .38 with ink running out</a>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">3. The gray pen size .5</a>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">4. The dark-green pen in .38 that slides mores smoothly than the other ones; it is your favorite pen.</a>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">5. The black-pen size .70 that is also your favorite pen, although you feel guilty for having 2 separate favorite pens, like they’re almost in competition with each other. You can’t decide which one you like more. <br><br>You feel guilty for favoring one pen over the other, almost like they’re your children, or like you're in a love triangle and can’t pick which partner to spend the rest of your life with. The consequences are dire, and the ambivalence towards these two pens morphs into shame. Do you even know who you are? You can’t make a simple decision between two, inanimate objects that are designed to be thrown out and purchased again anyways? They are temporary and say nothing about you as a person. But the fact that you don’t even know your own preferences, your own likes or dislikes, or the fact that you can’t make a decision about two simple pens to write your compulsive thoughts is so embarrassing.</a>

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_2/3-ThirdRound_2A.html">6. The generic plastic BIC pen you stole from work. You hate the way it slides over the paper in uneven fashion, and how the ink is inconsistent. You know using this pen will bring your great discomfort, but healing is all about putting yourself through discomfort, and so this might be the ‘right’ decision for you to make.</a>
