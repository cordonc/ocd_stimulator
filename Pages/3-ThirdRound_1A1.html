       <p class="thoughts-1">You picked take a shower. Gotta get that compulsion out of the way. The only way to get rid of the compulsion. </p>

       <p class="thoughts-2">Start brainstorming while doing your skin-care routine about possible project proposals you could write. You notice your eyes are a bit baggy, your skins a bit dry, and you can’t remember the last time you changed your contact lenses. To double check, you look on your phone the day you changed your 2-week contact lenses that you recorded 2 weeks ago. You begin to worry about your eye-sight and the potential affects over-used contact lenses have on eye sight. You make a mental note to check the effects of over-used contact lenses long-term.
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-3">Consider if you actually have time to do a skin-care routine when there’s a project proposal to be written. You remember the times your mother berated you for dry, flakey skin and feel a pang of embarrassment. One night of skipping the face routine will not dramatically effect your skin, you rationalize, but then you remember that preventative care is the most important when it comes to irreversible signs of damage and age. You make a mental note to yourself to look up what methods of preventative are the most effective.
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-4">Feeling clean and refreshed after your shower, you start to reconsider your decision to clean the sink, shower, and perform your routine skin-care routine. You feel guilty about your lack of self-control.
