                <p class="H2">You have to decide which clothes to wear in your closet. You notice your closet is unorganized and you haven’t sorted out the laundry between ‘worn once', to 'still wearable’, to ‘worn 3x but maybe nobody will notice potential bad smells’, to ‘absolutely egregious to wear in public’, to ‘clean’. <br><br>

                Your options are:

                <a class="body" href="/Pages_3/3-ThirdRound_3A1.html">1. Quickly organize your clothes into 5 piles for future reference.</a>
                <a class="body" href="/Pages_3/3-ThirdRound_3A1.html">2. Pick any running pants or shirts in the ‘worn once; still wearable’ pile or ‘clean’ pile. </a>
                    <a class="body" href="/Pages_3/3-ThirdRound_3A1.html">3. Grab any shorts and t-shirt and endure the dirty feeling of running in somewhat-quetionably-clean clothes. This is the option that will bring you the most discomfort, and healing is all about enduring uncomfortable feelings with dignity and strength. You already made the right decision to not deep-clean your sink, and so, this options also seem like the right decision for you to make. For sure. Totally. </a>
                <a class="body" href="/Pages_3/4-FourthRound_3A4.html"">4. Brew a cup of coffee. It's decision time and you need stimulation. This will definitly clear your head and potentially deflect another compulsions. </a>
