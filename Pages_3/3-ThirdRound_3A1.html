       <p class="thoughts-1">You sort out your clothes from the closet.  </p>

       <p class="thoughts-2">Your hands feel tainted touching the dirty clothes– but nevermind, you’ll wash you hands after anyways. I mean. You’re making the right decision here. Clean clothes to be separated from the somewhat clean clothes for maximum efficiency. You’re just doing the best you can. Sure, another 25mn to kill before going on your healthy run. But hey. It needs to be done.  Time is precious– and this is surely the best decision to make. 
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-3">You start to wonder about all the clothing you have and if you actually need this piece of clothing. Do you love it enough? Will someone else love it more if you donated to a shelter or consignment store? Maybe I’m withholding a piece of clothing from a stranger that would absolutely love it.
       </p>

       <p class="thoughts-4">Does that make me selfish? Irresponsible? Painfully self-involved? I mean why do I think my clothes are nice enough for other people to buy? For all I know I have bad taste.
